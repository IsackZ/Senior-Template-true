        Some day on Reddit, I found a joke video of a Mortal Kombat selection screen filled with celebrities and world leaders.
        I thought that was a funny concept, so when Ms.Orret announced we were going to create a game, that's what I decided on 
        making.

      </p>
      <p class="section-body">
        I never made a game before, and barely played any fighting games so it was certainly going to be a challenge.
        However, in the end, I feel pretty good about what we have gotten done even if we aren't finished.

            This project was made by Conway and I. I was the main programmer
            that coded and implemented the attacks. Conway was the main
            designer, and created the character sprites.

      <p class="section-title">The Initial Design</p>
      <p class="section-body">
        We planned on making the game with multiple characters that had the same kinds of moves: a punch, kick, block, 
        powerup move, and projectile. The goal was just to make a parody game about previous and current world leaders
        with simple and easy to pick up move sets. 
        
      </p>
      <p class="section-body">
        To begin we just created Xi, and a basic Chinese backdrop. We first created a sprite sheet for his animations then animated his moveset.
        After finishing Xi, we plan on making other characters, such as Putin, Obama, and Kim Jong Un. 
      </p>
      <p class="section-body">
        Currently we want to add more and focus on completing the game with a wider catalouge of characters.
        We also then plan on balancing the abilities and characters before deciding the game is complete.<br /><br />
