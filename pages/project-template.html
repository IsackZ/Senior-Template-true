      <p class="section-body">
        For the 2024 app academy hackathon project, me and a group of friends decided to do a 
        dungeon crawler for our project. The theme was to travel between islands with procedurally 
        generated islands and floors.

      </p>
      <p class="section-body">
        My only previous experience with game creation was with Godot and the World leaders game
        and since the time given was limited, it was certainly a challenge.

            This project was made by me, Conway, Elis, and Eric. I was the main coder, while Eric worked on room creation, and   
            Conway and Elis on charactor creation.

      <p class="section-title">The Design</p>
      <p class="section-body">
        Our goal was to create a procedurally generated game that generated dungeon rooms randomly.
        It was a simple dungeon crawler design with a wide variety of weapons and fun abilities. 
        
        
      </p>
      <p class="section-body">
        To begin we created the base character and animated their sprite, while also adding in some basic rooms and enemies. 
        Our goal then became to create the procedural generation algorithm. Unfortunately since procedural generation took so long,
        we couldn't complete most of the rest of our concepts. 
      </p>
      <p class="section-body">
        Currently we want to add more and focus on completing the game with a wider catalouge of abilities, enemies and weapons.
        The game is far from complete, and we plan on possibly publishing it once it is done.<br /><br />
